# The Next Twitter ü™Å

## Description
An API for a social networking web app. Perhaps it will be the next Twitter! Users can post their thoughts, add new friends, and react to their friends' thoughts. 

The backbone is made up of Express.js, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose for the ODM (object data modeling). Testing is done using Insomnia.
